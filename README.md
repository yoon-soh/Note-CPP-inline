# inline (C++)
## 1. Explanation

>makes a function inline. Whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of the inline function call. This eliminates function call overhead.

## 3. Restriction

>The definition of an inline function must be in the same translation unit. In other words, any inline function must be defined in header.

ex1)
```
// header.h

class S
{
public:
    inline int square(int s) // redundant use of inline
    {
        // this function is automatically inline
        // function body
    }
};
```
ex2)
```
// header.h

class S
{
public:
    int square(int s); // declare the function
};

inline int S::square(int s) // use inline prefix
{
}
```

- ["The definition of an inline function or variable(since C++17) must be reachable in the translation unit where it is accessed (not necessarily before the point of access)."](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/inline)
- ["A given inline member function must be declared the same way in every compilation unit. There must be exactly one definition of an inline function."](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/inline-functions-cpp?view=msvc-170)

## 4. Note

>inline keyword is suggestion. Therefore, compiler can ignore this suggestion depending on the situation. (ex. inline function that is called recursively)

["The compiler treats the inline expansion options and keywords as suggestions. There's no guarantee that functions will be inlined. You can't force the compiler to inline a particular function, even with the __forceinline keyword."](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/inline-functions-cpp?view=msvc-170)
